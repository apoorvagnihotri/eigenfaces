# Intro
This repository implements [EigenFaces paper](http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/pca/jcn.pdf). This is a algorithm that tries to recognize and detec faces using PCA.

# Usage
The `src.py` file contains the class EigenFaces, whose usage is given in `demo.py` over the [ATnT face dataset](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html).
Run `demo.py` for a sample run.

# Requirements
```
python 3.7.0
opencv-python 3.4.2.16
opencv-contrib-python 3.4.2.16
numpy 1.15.2
```
