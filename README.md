# Intro
This repository implements [EigenFaces paper](http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/pca/jcn.pdf). This is a algorithm that tries to recognize and detec faces using PCA.

# Usage
The `src.py` file contains the class EigenFaces, whose usage is given in test.py over the [ATnT face dataset](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html).
Run `demo.py` for a sample run.

# Requirements
This repository is tested for `python3.7`. Other requirements include:
* `numpy`
* `opencv3`
*
